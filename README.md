# How to setup

Have python on your system, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to Use

There are two ways to create graphs, using the scripts in the `standalone` directory, or creating the graphs through the webapp. To run the webapp, type `python app.py` in the terminal inside the main directory. To run the standalone scripts, navigate to the `standalone` directory, edit the required parameters, and run the preferred script.

In order for the application to run properly, the input file must be a .csv file. Furthermore the first 3 columns in the csv file must correspond to latitude, longitude, and depth in that order.
